# Using Aurora for direct point-to-point communications

## Introduction

This repository is based on the [example](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/tree/2023.2/Hardware_Acceleration/Design_Tutorials/08-alveo_aurora_kernel) from Xilinx and provides you a ready-to-link, packaged Aurora IP which works on four QSFP28 lanes, has Flow Control implemented and reaches 100Gb/s throughput.

It is tested on the Alveo U280 card with XRT 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16.

The packaged aurora kernel has the following structure.

## How to build it

You can build the packaged kernel with the following command:

```
    make aurora
```

This provides a kernel for each QSFP port. Pay attention to the numbers, because of constraints issues when using the same kernel for both QSFP ports, we need a different kernel for each QSFP port. Link `aurora_hls_0.xo` with QSFP port 0 and `aurora_hls_1.xo` with QSFP port 1.


Each kernel has one AXI stream for sending and one for receiving data. Connect them in your link script with the application kernels.

An example link config for U280 can be found [here](./aurora_hls_test_hw.cfg).

### Framing

By default the AXI streams are using streaming, so you don't have to set the last and keep bit. If you want to enable framing you can use the following setting:

```
  make aurora USE_FRAMING=1
```

This has the advantage, that the aurora core uses CRC for checking every frame. There are internal counters, which count the number of frames and the number of frames with errors.

Using framing on this high line rate has stringent timing requirements. If you have trouble routing, consider going back to streaming.

### Flow Control

The built-in flow control logic uses the programmable threshold status flags of the receiving FIFO to tell the sender side to stop transmission, when the full threshold is reached. The receiving side requests to start transmission again, when the empty threshold is reached. 

The FIFO on the receiving side can be configured with the following options. The depth of the FIFO can be configured in powers of two ranging from 16 to 16384. The thresholds for programmable full and programmable empty can be any number, as long they are not too close to zero or completly full.
```
  make aurora RX_FIFO_DEPTH=512 RX_FIFO_PROG_FULL=384 RX_FIFO_PROG_EMPTY=128
```

The distance between full and programmable full should be large enough to catch the values, which are still transmitted, so no transmissions are lost. The distance between empty and programmable empty should be large enough, so the FIFO does not run empty while waiting for receiving new data. In the test setup on Noctua2 there are a maximum of 150 transmissions, which corresponds to a FIFO depth of 75. If you want to verify this for your setup you can enable a integrated logic analyzer for the NFC module, which also probes the valid signal of the receiving side, to count the number of transmissions. Pay attention that the valid signal after the datawidth converter is used, because probing the valid signal of the aurora core itself is very difficult to route. With the regular setup of a FIFO width of 64 bytes, one transmission after the datawidth converter corresponds to two transmissions with the aurora core, which has a width of 32 bytes.

Use the following command to enable the debug probe for the NFC module:

```
make aurora PROBE_NFC=1
```

### Configure FIFO width

By default the FIFO and therefore the streams for input and output have a width of 64 bytes. This is the width which is also needed to reach the maximum throughput of 100Gbit/s. If you have a special application which needs another width, this is also configurable. But be careful, because other sizes have not been tested.

```
  make aurora FIFO_WIDTH=32
```

### Configure Equalization Parameters

The equalization parameters of the GTY transceivers can also be configured. The defaults are the following which are suited to a setup where the optical links contribute around 2dB and an optical switch which contributes around 6dB.

```
  make aurora INS_LOSS_NYQ=8 RX_EQ_MODE=LPM
```

The loss can theoretically configured in a range from 0.0 to 25.0, but this design supports only integer values right now, which should be sufficient for the most cases. The possible values for the mode are "LPM", "DFE" and "AUTO".

## How to use it

The aurora core is freerunning and therefore just works. But it can be useful, to check if the connections are up, before running a program, so link configuration errors are easier to detect. For this the [./host/Aurora.hpp](./host/Aurora.hpp) header can be included in your program as a utility. The most important functions are the following.

Create the class. The first parameter is the instance used, either 0 or 1 depending which QSFP port you want to choose. The others needed are the xrt::device and the xrt::uuid of the bitstream.

```
  Aurora aurora(0, device, xclbin_uuid); 
```

This assumes the naming convention used in the example link script, to create the xrt::ip object of the aurora core. You can also pass the xrt::ip object directly.


```
  Aurora aurora(ip);
```

The status can be checked with the following function, which returns true if the status is ok, which means that the channel is up and alive all other status bits are in the wanted state. As the creation of the link can take some time in the beginning, a timeout in milliseconds is given, after which the function returns false, if the status is not ok. If the status is not ok and you want to see the reason, you can use a function to print the complete aurora core status.

```
  if (aurora.core_status_ok(3000)) {
    std::cout << "Everything is fine" << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "Something is wrong, let's have a look" << std::endl;
    aurora.print_core_status();
  }
```

There are also functions for checking the configuration and more status signals. If you need them, take a look into the code. Following are some examples.

```
if (aurora.has_framing()) {
    // dont forget to set the last and keep bit
}

uint32_t frames_with_errors = aurora.get_frames_with_errors();
if (frames_with_errors > 0) {
    // some bits have flipped during transmission
}

// get a print of the configuration of the core
aurora.print_configuration();
```


### Testbenches

The verilog modules for flow control, CRC frame counting and for the configuration have testbenches, which can be executed with:

```
  make run_nfc_tb
  make run_crc_counter_tb
  make configuration_tb
```

## Example design

The example design is inspired by the original Xilinx example and contains a simple issue and a simple dump kernel, which just transmit and receive the data. The bitstream contains 2 instances for both qsfp ports. When using MPI every rank controls one qsfp port, so it scales to three FPGAs on one node with 6 ranks, for example.

### Build the example

You can build the example design with the following commands.

```
  make host
  make xclbin
```

It is also possible to build a design for software emulation. But this skips the aurora kernels and just connects the issue with the dump kernels and is only used for verifying the correctness of the HLS kernels and the host code.

```
  make xclbin TARGET=sw_emu
```


### Test the example

The host application offers the following parameters
```
-m megabytes        Specify the amount of data to be transmitted in megabytes.
-b bytes            Specify the amount of data to by transmitted in bytes. This overrides the megabytes seting
-p path             Path to the bitstream file. Default is "aurora_hls_test_hw.xclbin"
-r repetitions      Number of repetitions of the test.
-i iterations       Number of iterations of the test inside the kernel
-f frame_size       The size of the frame in framing mode. The size is measured in multiples of the datawidth
-n test_nfc         Enables the NFC test
-a use_ack          Enables the acknowledgement between every iteration in the kernel
-t timeout_ms       The timeout used for waiting on a channel and on finish for the HLS kernels
-o device_id_offset Offset for selecting the FPGA device id
-w wait             Wait for enter after loading the xclbin
-s semaphore        Lock the results file with atomic rename before writing to it

```

The default behavior is to just transmit the data according to the parameters and calculate and print the average throughput. The results for each repetition are also written to a csv file. An exemplary analysis of the data can be found in a [jupyter notebook](./eval/eval.ipynb)

The -w flag is needed for using chipscope on this design. After loading the bitstream the execution stops and waits for a press on enter. This enables to setup the debug_hw server before the execution starts.

There are two more special test cases. The first one is testing the flowcontrol by starting the dump kernel 10 seconds later than the issue kernel, which is enabled by the -n flag.

When scaling this test to multiple nodes, the -s flag can used to guarantee that only one job is writing to results file at once. Beware that the file must exist, otherwise the application will wait forever on it.

By default, the first two ranks will choose the device with index 0, going up with the next ranks. This can be changed with specifying an offset, for this selection procedure. This is useful, for example, when only one specific device needs to be tested.

### Latency test

The second is the so-called latency test, which tests different message sizes with different iterations. Enabling the latency test with the -l flag also sets the use_ack parameter to true. The number of repetitions are calculated, so that every possible message sizes in powers of two up to the given number of bytes and not smaller than the frame size is tested. The acknowledgement synchronizes between every iteration of the issue and dump kernel, so that the actual transfer time is measurable. Otherwise this would just behave as a larger message size. The given number of iterations is the base for the largest message and is increased with smaller message sizes. The following is an example for the largest possible messagesize and the smallest possible framesize.

```
./host_aurora_hls_test -l -i 20 -f 1

Repetition 0 - 64 bytes - 41943040 iterations
Repetition 1 - 128 bytes - 20971520 iterations

Repetition 21 - 134217728 bytes - 20 iterations
Repetition 22 - 268435456 bytes - 10 iterations
```

### Noctua2

There are scripts available for running on the [Noctua 2](https://pc2.uni-paderborn.de/hpc-services/available-systems/noctua2) cluster. A tested set of modules can be loaded with the following command.

```
  source env.sh
```

There is one script for simple synthesis and one for synthesing one bitstream with streaming and one with framing. Both bitstreams are needed for running the [full latency test](./scripts/run_latency_test.sh).

For quick testing, there are two scripts, which do a simple run on either 3 or 6 FPGAs (1 or 2 nodes).

There is also a helper script which runs a given script for every available FPGA node. You can use it with scripts which are running on one node.

```
./scripts/for_every_node.sh ./scripts/run_latency_test.sh
```
